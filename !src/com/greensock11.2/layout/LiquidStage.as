/**
 * LiquidStage allows you to "pin" DisplayObjects to reference points on the stage (or inside other DisplayObjects) 
 * so that when the stage is resized, they are repositioned and maintain their relative distance from
 * the PinPoint. For example, you could make a logo Sprite stay in the bottom right corner when the stage is resized.
 * 
 * You can also scale or stretch DisplayObjects using the LiquidArea class which allows you to define a rectangular
 * area that expands and contracts as the stage resizes, and you attach DisplayObjects so that they
 * fill the area, scaling in any of the following modes: <code>STRETCH, PROPORTIONAL_INSIDE, PROPORTIONAL_OUTSIDE, WIDTH_ONLY,</code>
 * or <code>HEIGHT_ONLY</code>. For example, you could have a bar snap to the bottom of the screen and 
 * stretch horizontally to fill the width of the stage. Or add a background image that proportionally scales 
 * to fill the entire stage.<br /><br />
 *	
 * There are a few things that make LiquidStage particularly useful:
 *	<ul>
 *		<li> Your DisplayObjects do not need to be at the root level - LiquidStage will compensate for nesting even if the DisplayObject's
 *		  anscestors are offset and/or scaled. </li>
 *		<li> By default, repositioning only factors in the amount of change in the PinPoint's position, meaning 
 * 			you are free to move the DisplayObject manually and LiquidStage will honor its new position instead of 
 * 			forcing it to always remain a certain distance from the PinPoint (although a "strict" mode is available too).</li>
 *		<li> Not only can you pin things to the <code>TOP_LEFT, TOP_CENTER, TOP_RIGHT, RIGHT_CENTER, BOTTOM_RIGHT, 
 * 			BOTTOM_CENTER, BOTTOM_LEFT, LEFT_CENTER,</code> and <code>CENTER</code>, but you can create your own 
 * 			custom PinPoints in any DisplayObject.</li>
 *		<li> LiquidStage leverages the TweenLite engine to allow for animated transitions. Simply define the duration 
 * 			of the tween and optionally pass in a tween vars object to control other aspects of the tween like its
 * 			ease, delay, add an onComplete, onUpdate, etc.</li>
 *		<li> LiquidStage does NOT force you to align the stage to the upper left corner - it will honor whatever StageAlign you choose.</li>
 *		<li> Optionally define a minimum/maximum width and height to prevent objects from repositioning when the stage 
 * 			gets too small or too big.</li>
 *		<li> LiquidStage only does its work when the stage resizes, and it is built for maximum performance.</li>
 *	</ul> 
 *	
 *	
 * @example Example AS3 code:<listing version="3.0">
import com.greensock.layout.~~;

//create a LiquidStage instance for the current stage which was built at an original size of 550x400
//don't allow the stage to collapse smaller than 550x400 either.
var ls:LiquidStage = new LiquidStage(this.stage, 550, 400, 550, 400);
 
//attach a "logo" Sprite to the BOTTOM_RIGHT PinPoint
ls.attach(logo, ls.BOTTOM_RIGHT);

//create a 300x100 rectangular area at x:50, y:70 that stretches when the stage resizes (as though its top left and bottom right corners are pinned to their corresponding PinPoints on the stage)
var area:LiquidArea = new LiquidArea(this, 50, 70, 300, 100);

//attach a "myImage" Sprite to the area and set its ScaleMode to PROPORTIONAL_INSIDE and horizontally and vertically align it in the center of the area
area.attach(myImage, ScaleMode.PROPORTIONAL_INSIDE, AlignMode.CENTER, AlignMode.CENTER);

//if you'd like to preview the area visually (by default previewColor is red), set preview to true
area.preview = true;
 
//attach a RESIZE event listener to the LiquidStage instance (you could do this with the LiquidArea as well)
ls.addEventListener(Event.RESIZE, onLiquidStageUpdate);
function onLiquidStageUpdate(event:Event):void {
	trace("updated LiquidStage");
}

</listing>
 *		
 * <b>NOTES / LIMITATIONS:</b>
 * <ul>
 *		<li> You need to set up your objects on the stage initially with the desired relative distance between
 * 			them and their PinPoint; LiquidStage doesn't reposition them initially. For example, if you want
 * 			logo_mc to be exactly 20 pixels away from the BOTTOM_RIGHT corner of the stage on both axis (x and y),
 * 			you must put it there before attach()-ing it.</li>
 *		<li> If a DisplayObject is not in the display list (has no parent), LiquidStage will ignore it until it 
 * 			is back in the display list.</li>
 * 		<li> If you plan to set the <code>align</code> property of your stage, do so before creating its LiquidStage
 * 			instance.</li>
 * 		<li> LiquidStage is a <a href="http://www.greensock.com/club/">Club GreenSock</a> membership benefit.

		 * does NOT force it to share the same coordinates as the PinPoint - it simply causes the PinPoint's 
		 * movement to proportionally affect the position of the DisplayObject. The relationship is one-way
		 * so moving the DisplayObject will not move the PinPoint. Unless the <code>strict</code> parameter
		 * is <code>true</code>, changes are relative so you are free to move the DisplayObject as you wish and when the 
		 * PinPoint's position changes, its proportional movement will honor the DisplayObject's new position
		 * instead of forcing it back to the same distance from the PinPoint. But again, you can set
		 * the <code>strict</code> parameter to <code>true</code> if you want to force the object to always 
		 * maintain a certain distance from the PinPoint<br /><br />
		 * 
		 * For example, if your object is 100 pixels away from the PinPoint and the PinPoint moves 15 pixels,
		 * the DisplayObject will move 15 pixels as well (or however many pixels it takes to maintain its relative
		 * distance to the PinPoint which may be more or less than 15 pixels if it is nested inside a scaled parent).
		 * Strict mode, however, will force the DisplayObject to maintain its exact distance away from the PinPoint
		 * (no manual position changes will be honored when LiquidStage updates).
		 * 
		 * @param target The DisplayObject to attach
		 * @param pin The PinPoint to which the target should be attached (like <code>TOP_RIGHT</code> or <code>CENTER</code> or a custom PinPoint)
		 * @param strict In strict mode, the target will be forced to remain <b>EXACTLY</b> the same distance from the pin as it was when it was attached. If strict is false, LiquidStage will honor any manual changes you make to the target's position, making it more flexible. Note that LiquidStage only performs updates to the target's position when the stage resizes and/or when <code>update()</code> is called.
		 * @param reconcile If true, the target's position will immediately be moved as far as the PinPoint has moved from its original position, effectively acting as though the target was attached BEFORE the stage was scaled. If you attach an object after the stage has been scaled and you don't want it to reconcile with the PinPoint initially, set <code>reconcile</code> to <code>false</code>.
		 * @param tweenDuration To make the target tween to its new position instead of immediately moving there, set the tween duration (in seconds) to a non-zero value. A <code>TweenLite</code> instance will be used for the tween.
		 * @param tweenVars To control other aspects of the tween (like ease, onComplete, delay, etc.), use an object just like the one you'd pass into a <code>TweenLite</code> instance as the 3rd parameter (like <code>{ease:Elastic.easeOut, delay:0.2}</code>)
